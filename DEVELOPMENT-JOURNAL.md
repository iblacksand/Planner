#Development Journal

## Journal entry for the week of Jan 22 - 29

 During this week I finished the proposal file and started to think on ideas for commands. I thought about adding 'ask' and 'answer' subsets of the display function of which can be used as following:
 'display.ask what is your favorite color?'
 'display.answer.prop(cs) blue'
 It would display "what is your favorite color?" and ask for user input. It would only accept the answer blue, which is case sensitive, before moving on in the script.
 I also have been working the .prop(string property) which allows for special properties to the command. I think this will be the most useful in the display command but could be used for auto-closing the program that was run, or a loop that ends if a step is not completed. This would be hard to compile but I think I could do it. I have thought of these tags so far:
 'cs' - case-sensitive
 'ac' - auto-closes whatever is attached after time limit
 'f' - 'fragile' - breaks this if anything above it fails.
 These are the ideas I have so far. Hopefully I am able to add these since they would add a lot of functionality to the program.
