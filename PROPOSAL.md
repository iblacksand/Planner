# Proposal: Advanced Planner
## A program that allows you to set time limits for certain activities, with advanced functions to increase productivity
John Elizarraras

## Needs and Opportunities
This program can be used not only for keeping a schedule, but you could also use it to help you study vocabulary for spanish. It will allow you to create a schedule that you will stick to. In combination with this it is customizable with shortcuts, aliases and others. This supplies the solution to an automated, customizable schedule that will allow you to be more productive in your daily life.

## Audience / Clients / Users
The audience for Advanced Planner is anyone who wants to increase their productivity by having a fixed schedule. It can also be used to display images, like a slideshow, with a time limit on each image. It can also be used for almost an infinite amount of things with the ability to customize with provided syntax.

## Product
This is a script based program that has its own syntax that allows many different fuctions this includes:

* run - used to run a program. For example "run chrome for 5 min"
* loop - used to loop through a list of other commands. For example "loop 5s 5". This will loop the following commands (inside brackets) five times with five seconds inbetween
* display - used to display a certain text. For example "display hello world" will show hello world on the screen
* more commands to come

These commands won't have to be memorized with a custom GUI that will do the basic funtions. Learning the commands will allow you to do more advanced things with the set commands.It will also allow aliases to be used to execute code that you wrote before. For example, if you want to make a script that will go through a daily routine you can just do : "alias dailyroutine dailyroutine.txt". This allows you to quickly start your daily routine without the hassle of creating the script everytime.

The special thing about this specific planner is the ability to "compile" the code before it is run. It allows you to know if the script you wrote will compile all the way through without having errors occur in the middle of your script. It is not garunteed success but will eliminate lots of small mistakes.

This program is an easy solution to having to time yourself, while also providing a simple syntax that can be used for many different advanced things.

## Timeline

This is my timeline for the project

You can look at [DELIVERABLES.md](https://github.com/iblacksand/advanced-planner/blob/master/DELIVERABLES.md) to see the progress of each deliverable

__Bolded Text is modifications to timeline__

## Reality Check
The biggest resource this will is other people testing. This is the biggest part because I may know how to use it, but it doesn't mean others will. This is why I will open testing pretty quick. I know friends/relatives who are good at coding so it won't be too hard to find testers. It won't cost any money, except for power bills, so there is no problem there. The one problem might have is time management, which is why I created a checklist that way I know what needs to be done in the time period.

## Conclusion
This project is something I look forward doing, mainly because most of the stuff(GUI's and text editing) is something we haven't talked much about and will make me learn it in a way that is different. I think this project is worth while because it is something people, myself included, would use. It is something that is complex; It contains a compiler, simple GUI and alias support. I look forward to working on this project and hopefully others do too.
